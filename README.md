Python Classical RK4 ODE Solver for System of Two Ordinary Differential Equations

Mathematical calculations: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/721076/

# ODEs Used in Program
x'(t) = x(t) - y(t) + 2t - t^2 - t^3 <br />
y'(t) = x(t) + y(t) - 4t^2 + t^3 <br />
Where <br />
x(0) = 1 <br />
y(0) = 0 <br />
t in [0,1]
               
# ODE solutions
x(t) = e^t * cos(t) + t^2 <br />
y(t) = e^t * sin(t) - t^3
